In this assignment, I have  predicted the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc.
You'll use the dataset from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.
The price has been predicted using technique called Random Forests by tuning its hyperparameters.
